<h2>THE WOMAN, THE MAN AND THE N&#x0100;T.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">IN every large tree there lives a N&#x0101;t,
and it is a custom very strictly
adhered to that before any tree can be
touched the permission of the spirit
must be asked and obtained.</p>

<p>Now a woodman cut down a tree one
day without giving the N&#x0101;t who resided
in it the slightest warning, a proceeding
which infuriated the spirit exceedingly,
and he determined to be revenged;
so, taking upon himself without delay
the exact form and likeness of the
woodman, he gathered up a bundle of
sticks and went in advance of him to
his home, in the brief warm gloom<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
that precedes the fall of night. When
he reached the hut, that was as bare
as a hermit's cell, thatched with dunni
leaves, and situated in one of the
deepest recesses of the dense sylvan
growth, he placed the wood outside and
went within. An oil lamp stood on
the wooden ledge of the entrance and
threw a faint light on all around. The
wife of the woodcutter was busy boiling
the evening rice, a baby slept in its box-like
cradle slung from a beam in the
roof; a little boy of five or six sat
cutting plaintain leaves.</p>

<p>The N&#x0101;t greeted the woman; she
answered him cheerily. Then he
squatted down on a piece of matting.</p>

<p>The rice being ready, the wife put it
out on the plaintain leaves, giving one to
her supposed husband, one to the boy,
and keeping the other for herself.
They ate together, and when they had<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
finished drank some water from the
chatty standing near. Then they sat
and smoked, and talked together of
the many little trifling events which
went to make up their world. The
woman cleared away the remains of
their meal, and took out some betel
chews and commenced to roll them,
while the child slept behind the purdah.
About half an hour passed away
thus, when lo! on the stillness broke
the voice of the woodman calling to his
wife that he was coming, saying that he
had been delayed.</p>

<p>The woman heard in bewildered
astonishment, then turned to the N&#x0101;t,
who apparently had not heeded the
call, and asked him if she dreamt.</p>

<p>Then rising, she peered out into the
gloom, just faintly relieved by the rays
of a young moon, and beheld the form
of a woodcutter coming between the<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
trees, identically the same in figure and
face as her husband who was there
beside her. The new-comer called her
by her name again, bidding her prepare
something for him to eat, as he
was tired and hungry.</p>

<p>He threw the wood down that he
carried, and entered, but staggered back
on seeing his counterpart squatting,
quite at home, on the ground. The
woman looked from one to the other,
and knew not what to do or think.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments.
Then he who had come last asked,
when he had sufficiently recovered himself
to speak&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is this man who bears so
strange a likeness to me?"</p>

<p>"I am the husband of this woman,"
answered the N&#x0101;t calmly, not even
removing his green-leaf cigar from
between his lips.<span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>"That cannot be," exclaimed the
other indignantly, "because I am he."</p>

<p>The N&#x0101;t shook his head, and went
on smoking.</p>

<p>The woodcutter, mad with anger and
astonishment, turned excitedly to his
wife, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, I, your
husband, who left you only this
morning? Do you not know me, or
do you forget so soon, that you accept
a stranger in my place?"</p>

<p>The woman looked from one to the
other, and examined each carefully, and
was more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, wife, do you not know me, do
you not know me?" moaned the woodman
in a grief-stricken voice.</p>

<p>The woman wrung her hands as she
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know if you are my husband;
you are both so much alike that<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
I cannot tell." Then she broke down
and wept.</p>

<p>And the N&#x0101;t hearing, smiled where
he sat in the shadows.</p>

<p>After awhile the woman dried her
tears, smoothed back her heavy masses
of black hair, and asked what was to
be done.</p>

<p>They neither of them answered. Then
she said, "Let us go and seek Manoo,
and abide by what he says."</p>

<p>Manoo was a very learned judge, who
had been appointed, while still quite
young, Chief Justice of the King's
Court, and was renowned for the wise
and prudent judgments that he invariably
pronounced.</p>

<p>The N&#x0101;t objected to the proposition.
Secretly he feared that Manoo might
perhaps guess his identity; but the
woodman assented eagerly to his wife's
idea, and between them they overcame<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
the other's dislike, and the three started
without delay, going through the forest
between the silvered line of palm-trees;
the fire-flies danced before them, and the
bats flitted by like ghosts in the warm
darkness. All that night and part of
the next they travelled, until they
reached the Court of Manoo, which was
a large white building, supported by
chunamed pillars, and with many carved
doors.</p>

<p>The judge himself, magnificently
arrayed, sat upon a raised couch, that
was covered with scarlet satin, richly
embroidered, and with a heavy fringe of
gold and jewels edging it.</p>

<p>The woman, the N&#x0101;t, and the woodman,
leaving their shoes at the gates,
entered, and, seating themselves at a
respectful distance on separate pieces of
matting, told their tale.</p>

<p>The judge listened in silence to the<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
end; then he asked the woman if her
husband had any particular mark on him
by which she could distinguish him.</p>

<p>Her face lightened as she answered
that he had a black mark on his back
and a red scar on his knee. Then
Manoo had both men examined carefully,
but found that each had the same
marks in the same places.</p>

<p>The woman became more hopelessly
bewildered than ever, and knew not
what to make of the extraordinary
circumstance; while the judge found
himself in a position of considerable
difficulty.</p>

<p>He saw that he would have to consider
the matter carefully for some
time; so he bade them go, and return
on the following day at the same hour.</p>

<p>Then he went home to his house,
which was a gift from his royal master,
and was situated on a rocky promontory,<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
with the sea rolling up almost to the
entrance. Seating himself alone in his
study&mdash;the windows of which looked out
over the water to where a rich sunset
glowed westward, edging the waves with
freckled lustre, and throwing purple,
amber, and azure lights over the white-crested
waves&mdash;he became absorbed in
deep thought, as a result of which he
came to a solution of the matter. On
the next day, therefore, when his three
strange applicants presented themselves
before him, he had a wooden wheel
brought into the room and placed in
the middle of the floor, saying at the
same time&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man who shall go through the
hole in that wheel will be a wonderful
man, and will be recognised as the real
husband of this woman."</p>

<p>On hearing which the woodman protested,
saying that it was impossible for<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
any human being to go through so small
a space, that it was only large enough
to admit of an arm; and he grumbled
greatly, saying that the test was very
unfair.</p>

<p>But Manoo bade him be patient and
silent yet awhile. Then he turned to
the N&#x0101;t, and asked him what he thought.
The N&#x0101;t, who was laughing inwardly, at
once replied that he could perform the
task that the woodcutter deemed impossible.
The judge smiled a little
complacently as he bade him do it.</p>

<p>The N&#x0101;t immediately went to and fro
through the hole with the greatest ease,
the woman looking on in speechless
amaze.</p>

<p>Then said Manoo&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suspected yesterday that you were
no mortal, but a visitor from the N&#x0101;t
country, and now I am, of course,
convinced of it."<span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>The N&#x0101;t hung his head, and the judge
proceeded, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why have you come from your own
world, taking upon yourself this form
and shape, thereby causing so much
pain and unhappiness to two innocent
people?"</p>

<p>The N&#x0101;t, seeing that he could no
longer carry on his course of deception,
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the season of the sun, and in that
of the rain, for a greater time than I
can count, I have lived in a tree in the
forest, where this woodman comes every
day. I troubled no one, and I was
content till two days ago, when he
felled my home to the ground with
neither warning given to or permission
asked of me. When other woodcutters
have come, they have and do always
crave permission of the N&#x0101;t residing in
the tree to take from it even one branch.<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
Therefore you must see that I have had
just cause to be angry."</p>

<p>Manoo then said that the woodman
had certainly been wrong in the way he
had acted. Then, turning to the woman,
he directed her and her husband to hang
up a dried cocoa-nut on the best side of
their hut for the N&#x0101;t to make his home
in&mdash;an order which they promised to
speedily obey.</p>

<p>The N&#x0101;t said that he was satisfied
with that arrangement.</p>

<p>Then the three, thanking the judge,
withdrew and went homewards.</p>

<p>From that time forth all Burmese
people hung, and still hang, dried cocoa-nut
in their houses for the spirits to
dwell in.</p>

<h2>A FABLE.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">TWO dogs walked in the jungle
together. The day was intensely
hot, the rays of the sun, hardly tempered
with any shade, fell through the towering
bamboos and palm-trees down on their
tired heads.</p>

<p>They had come far; the way was
very rough, the undergrowth very
tangled and dense. There seemed to
be no end to it. Their vision in front
was obscured by the extraordinary wealth
of orchids and green foliage that was
gracefully but thickly festooned from
branch to branch.</p>

<p>Snakes glided away in the deep grass.
Monkeys, squirrels, and birds of all<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
kinds contended for the undisputed
possession of the different trees.</p>

<p>"I am very tired; I don't think I
can go much farther," said the lady dog,
who was small and delicate, to her companion.</p>

<p>"So also am I," was the answer.</p>

<p>"It was foolish ever to have come,"
grumbled the first.</p>

<p>"It was your fault," snapped the
second.</p>

<p>"I did not say it wasn't, did I?"
retorted the other, who, female-like, had
the last word.</p>

<p>Then they went on in silence for
awhile. They both felt cross and
hungry; and when you are hungry and
a dog bananas are not very satisfying,
and they were the only things near.</p>

<p>Presently they came to where a small
stream flowed; the water was quite
warm, but they drank it and were grateful.<span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>Then they rested, going on again just
when the last rays of the sun still showed
above the dusky palm tops.</p>

<p>They hoped to reach a village before
nightfall; but they were doomed to be
disappointed. There was not a sign of
any habitation near when the darkness
began to close around. The stars twinkled
brightly in a clear violet sky of wondrous
brilliancy. Close beside them was a
tiger's den&mdash;empty. They crept in and
sank down, too weary to go further.</p>

<p>There were signs of its having been
recently occupied, but they did not heed
them; and gnawed ravenously at some
half-eaten bones that were strewed
about.</p>

<p>Then they curled themselves up in
one corner and slept. After a few hours
the lady dog woke up and looked about
her. Through the opening she saw the
moonlight falling on the country outside;<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
everything was strangely still, save
for the distant cry of the jackal, and
the healthy snoring of her spouse, who
reposed in the corner. She felt alarmed,
she could not exactly have told why, and
awakened her companion, who grumbled
not a little at being thus rudely roused
from his slumbers.</p>

<p>"Supposing," began his companion,
not heeding his displeasure, "that the
tiger was to return."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the listener, sharply
jumping up in extreme alarm at the bare
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Don't make that unearthly noise,"
said the lady, calmly. "I only said
<i>supposing</i>, and I was going to ask you
what we should do in such a case."</p>

<p>"Do! why, what could we do?&mdash;nothing,
of course," was the somewhat
contemptuous reply.</p>

<p>Just then an ominous crackling of<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
the branches outside made them prick
their ears. Creeping close to the opening,
they looked out and saw in the
distance a large tiger coming towards
them, a white light, clear almost as
the dawn, fell about him, showing his
big head and striped back. The watchers
trembled exceedingly, and their teeth
rattled.</p>

<p>"There is no time to be lost,"
exclaimed the lady in a hoarse whisper.
"We must trust to his never having
seen any like us before, and we must
try and frighten him."</p>

<p>"Humbug and nonsense! Fancy
our frightening a tiger," said the gentleman
dog with infinite scorn.</p>

<p>"Never mind, we'll try; you sit at
the door while I remain in here. When
I roar&mdash;well, you'll see the effect."</p>

<p>The dog very unwillingly took up
his position at the entrance to the lair,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
and waited. In a second almost the
great beast came slouching along; his
gleaming eyes glanced hither and
thither, and there was blood upon his
mouth. Seeing the dog, he came to an
abrupt pause, and stared, then came a
little nearer, but very cautiously.</p>

<p>Just then there came a cry from
within, accompanied by the words, "I
am hungry, very hungry, and so are
the little ones, they crave more tiger's
flesh; be quick and bring it."</p>

<p>The tiger, hearing, waited for no
more, but turned and fled into the
night. He knew not what he had
seen, but the words that he had heard
had turned him cold with fear.</p>

<p>He flew on away into the wood, not
heeding where he went. Then, just as
the first rose flush of dawn overspread
the sky, he sank down exhausted, with
a cold perspiration all over him. He<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
fell into a troubled, weary doze, from
whence he was awakened by a banana
dexterously aimed, hitting him in the
eye. Looking up he saw a brown
monkey swinging itself on the branch
of a tree opposite, and regarding him
with all that gleeful self-satisfaction
which a monkey is alone capable of.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," it cried, mockingly,
"what has put you out? You
look strangely pale and upset this
morning."</p>

<p>"I have had sufficient cause," answered
the tiger, rising and shaking
himself; "for when I went home last
night I found it filled by the most
peculiar-looking animals that I have
ever seen, who shouted for my flesh."</p>

<p>The listener cocked its ugly little
head on one side as it munched bananas,
and asked, "What were they like?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," exclaimed the tiger.<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
"I was too frightened to see anything
save that they were white."</p>

<p>The monkey flung itself up higher
among the boughs and laughed loudly
and long.</p>

<p>"If you don't stop that hideous
noise I'll kill you," called out the tiger
very angrily, regardless of the fact that
he could not get within miles of his
tormentor.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! my friend," shouted the
monkey, "the things that you were
frightened of were two poor lean dogs,
that went by here yesterday. What a
great coward you are!"</p>

<p>"Coward or no coward, they would
have killed me and eaten me."</p>

<p>"Eaten you! Oh, you great silly
goose! With all your travels you
don't know any more than that dogs
can't kill you. You can kill dogs."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," protested the
tiger stolidly.<span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>"Don't then," said the monkey,
laconically, as he turned a somersault.</p>

<p>There was silence for a while. The
tiger sat down dejectedly while the
monkey watched him through the
leaves and chuckled maliciously, continuing
to eat noiselessly as he watched.</p>

<p>Having once had sufficient himself,
he was not indisposed to be a little
generous, so, taking some berries in one
brown paw, he climbed down nearer
the ground, and tendered them to his
melancholy friend as an overture, saying
as he did so&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eat and forget for awhile."</p>

<p>"I can never forget the loss of my
dear home," was the melancholy reply.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," retorted the other one,
who was practical, not sentimental, and
who had a hundred homes all equally
comfortable in the forest.<span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>"It's no nonsense," said the tiger,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed the monkey, after
a few seconds, "if you really are afraid
to go back, which is ridiculous, I will
come with you, for I fear no dogs."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trust you," replied the
tiger, ungraciously. "You have played
me a scurvy trick or two before
now."</p>

<p>The monkey became indignant, saying,
"It is just like your mean, suspicious
nature to speak so to a friend who, out
of pure good nature, is willing to do
you a turn. What motive can I have
save generosity?&mdash;no good can accrue
to me personally."</p>

<p>The tiger grunted an unwilling assent,
and began to think seriously of accepting
the offer.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "if you will
consent to be tied to my tail, and to go<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
in first to the den, my back being to
you, and face the dog, I am willing."</p>

<p>"Agreed," answered the monkey,
who was an interfering little creature,
and was longing to have his finger in
the pie.</p>

<p>So they went, the monkey tied to his
friend's tail, chattering all the way.</p>

<p>"Now," said the tiger, who was
sullen and afraid as they came in sight
of his lair, "if you don't behave fairly
to me I will murder you, that's all."</p>

<p>"Never fear; I won't give you the
opportunity of carrying out your
amiable intention, because I shall act
only as your true friend," replied the
monkey.</p>

<p>Then he pushed aside the thick-growing
foliage and entered into the
cave, the tiger keeping as far away as
possible, his hind-legs inside and the
rest of him out. The dogs were lying<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
down, but roused themselves on seeing
their visitor.</p>

<p>"Well, monkey," shouted one, "so
you have come at last, but that," looking
behind him, "is a very lean tiger that
you have brought. Why do you do so
when you know that we like them so
sleek and fat, and&mdash;&mdash;" but the monkey
heard no more. He was gone&mdash;jerked
violently away by the tiger, who, suspecting
his fidelity all along, was convinced
of his perfidy by the words of
the dog's greeting.</p>

<p>Away, away he sped, without turning
back, over hill and dale, bump, bump,
bang, bang, went the poor monkey's
body, while he vainly protested his
innocence in breathless, terrified shrieks.
At last death came and ended his
pain.</p>

<p>The two dogs sat and watched them
till their eyes grew tired.<span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>They laughed greatly as one said to
the other, "See what happened to the
monkey for interfering in other people's
business."</p>

<h2>THE STOLEN TREASURE.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">IN a lonely part of a large forest there
dwelt four wise men of India who
owned a treasure consisting of gold,
silver, and great jewels: like all property
it was a source of great anxiety
to its owners, for they always feared
that it would be stolen from them.
With that idea they constantly watched
it, counted it, and changed its hiding-place;
burying it sometimes under
trees, or in a ruined well that stood not
far distant; at other times with them in
the house.</p>

<p>For many long years they had kept
it safely thus, so safely indeed that<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
gradually they grew a little less zealous
in their guardianship: the confidence
born of long and unmolested peace
made them somewhat careless; and so
in some inexplicable manner news of its
existence floated to the ears of a young
man who dwelt in the town not so many
miles away, and he at once made up
his mind that he would become possessed
of it. Being wise he only took counsel
of himself, and bided his time with much
patience.</p>

<p>He made the acquaintance of the four
recluses, and watched their movements
and studied their habits with much
diligence. He was a handsome, high-spirited
youth, with manners that were
frank and engaging, and the old men
liked to see him and talk to him, soon
growing to look forward to his visits.</p>

<p>Months passed, and he went to see
them often. They conversed unreservedly<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
before him and trusted him as
one of themselves.</p>

<p>As time passed and no opportunity
of taking the treasure offered itself, he
began to be impatient, and was indeed
almost reduced to despair when he
learnt, to his inexpressible pleasure, that
they intended going on a day's pilgrimage
in the near future.</p>

<p>He laid his plans.</p>

<p>When the day came he rode to the
forest on a pony, and, dismounting,
fastened it near by as was his custom,
and went within. The garden, with its
moss-overgrown, decayed walls, was
quite still save for the song of the birds.
The sun fell through the leaves of the
trees and made brilliant patches of light
on the grass.</p>

<p>The rooms of the house were dark
and cool and empty. There were the
broken remains of a meal and various<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
things belonging to the absent masters
scattered about. The visitor looked
round and about him carefully, peering
here and there, then, having quite satisfied
himself that only he and the feathered
world shared the stillness, he smiled.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Some hours later the pilgrims returned
home: they had been far and were
wearied; they rested for awhile, then
ate their evening meal and prepared
to make ready for the night. As was
customary with them they went to look
at the treasure where they had put it in
an upper room, to find to their unspeakable
horror and dismay that it was gone.
They looked on one another in mute
amazement and despair; they beat their
breast; there were no words to describe
what they felt in that hour when they
bewailed its loss in a helpless, hopeless
way.<span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>After awhile one of them said&mdash;</p>

<p>"He who has come here so many
times of late with fair words and fairer
smiles, it is he who hath done this
thing."</p>

<p>The others agreed that it was only
he who could have, for no one else had
ever penetrated to their abode or shared
their confidence. Too late they bitterly
rued having ever received the stranger.</p>

<p>They sat long that night talking.
One said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have no proof save our own
conviction that he whom we met as
a friend and a brother has robbed us;
therefore what can we do?"</p>

<p>The others answered him&mdash;</p>

<p>"We will seek the King, to our
requests he has always leant a kind
and willing ear."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Meanwhile homeward through the<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
sultry night rode a horseman with a
heavy load.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When the dawn broke, they who had
been robbed set out together to seek
the Court of the King.</p>

<p>His Majesty, who was revered for his
goodness, had one daughter who to a
keen intellect united great beauty, and
was renowned throughout her father's
dominions and even in countries beyond
the sea.</p>

<p>Whenever the King or his ministers
were perplexed as to how to act in any
particular matter they invariably consulted
the Princess, who on each and all
such occasions had guided them aright;
while no chicanery or fraud ever passed
her undetected.</p>

<p>All that was brave, lofty, and good
she admired, honoured, and followed.
All that was mean, low, and dishonest
she abhorred.<span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>United to a powerful mind were
many womanly, gracious, and charitable
qualities, which made her beloved in
humble circles as well as respected in
high ones.</p>

<p>Therefore when the four petitioners
sought the King, it was with the idea
of humbly pleading for the Princess's
assistance.</p>

<p>The King, who knew them, received
them at once on their arrival and listened
to all that they had to say, agreeing with
them in their suspicions. He asked
them, when he had heard their story,
if they could identify the property if
they were to see it anywhere; to which
they answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>Then, bidding them rest and refresh
themselves, he went himself to the
apartments of his daughter and told
her the tale that he had heard. She
was very much interested, and gladly<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
promised to do what she could, telling
her father that if the young man could
be found and brought to the palace she
fancied that she could restore to them
their lost goods.</p>

<p>Whereupon the King consulted the
four, and a messenger was sent to search
and bring the young fellow with as little
delay as possible. The envoy of His
Majesty found him whom they desired
with but little difficulty, who received
the royal summons with much astonishment
and some fear. Instinctively he
felt that it was with regard to the stolen
jewels that he was sent for, and he
trembled not a little as he set out.</p>

<p>Were the theft ever to be discovered
he knew full well that his punishment
would not be a light one. Almost he
felt inclined to regret that he had ever
embarked on so hazardous a course, but
then the memory of the shining heaps<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
of gold and silver and the glittering
stones, and all that they represented,
came to him, and he laughed and shook
off all feelings of fear; for how, after all,
he said to himself, could they prove that
it was he who was the thief?</p>

<p>When he arrived at the palace, therefore,
he was quite light-hearted, and
walked through the lines of servants
with a haughty, self-confident air.</p>

<p>They ushered him through many
halls and at last into a large and most
beautifully decorated apartment situated
at the end of a long vista of salons.
The four walls had bas-reliefs of graceful
figures of women in coloured marble
and uncut jewels. The hangings were
of ivory satin, embroidered with
elephants and dragons in dead gold.
From the ceiling were suspended magnificent
lamps of many finely blended
colours. A large fountain splashed<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
softly near by; the floor was strewn
with tiger skins; the air was heavy with
strong perfume; while the light from
without stole in subdued and cool
through green blinds. But what
riveted the visitor's attention beyond
all else was a couch of immense dimensions
stretching across the upper end of
the room, reclining on which amongst
many cushions was a woman; overhead
was a canopy of fringed cloth supported
by delicately chased silver poles inlaid
with turquoises. On a table of mother-of-pearl
stood some cheroots and a glass
globe of water. Several attendants,
gorgeously attired, lounged near, and
created a breeze with fans made of
real roses.</p>

<p>The lady herself was very handsome,
with a clear skin of an almost olive
colour, great eyes of a velvety darkness,
and a soft, slow, sweet smile; pearls<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
clasped her throat, diamonds shone on
her fingers, while gold bracelets glittered
on her slender bare ankles. She
motioned her somewhat bewildered
visitor to seat himself near, and signed
to the attendants to withdraw.</p>

<p>He felt terribly nervous in the presence
of this royal lady: she watched
him in silence for a few moments,
fanning herself languidly the while;
she was uncertain as to how to open
the conversation. He was very handsome,
certainly, she thought, as she
looked, and with a figure as lithe and
graceful as that of a panther.</p>

<p>She raised herself a little and leant
forward slightly; he started and looked
at her apprehensively.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she began, "that you
are wondering why I sent for you?"</p>

<p>The tones of her voice were strangely
liquid and clear.<span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>The young man murmured something
indistinctly in response.</p>

<p>She continued, "But for some time
past, when the King and myself have
gone abroad, we have seen you often
and have desired to know you."</p>

<p>The listener was trembling so with joy,
relief, and surprise at hearing such words,
that he could find naught to say in reply.</p>

<p>Then she, perceiving his agitation,
spoke to him gently and kindly for a
few minutes, in order to give him time
to recover his self-possession. Then,
when he was more composed, she asked
him many questions about himself&mdash;questions
which he gladly answered.
Then after a while she bade him go
and to return on the morrow.</p>

<p>So he went from the seductive
presence of the Princess with his head
in a whirl, and feeling as if he dwelt no
longer on earth but in Nirvana.<span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>On the morrow he returned, and for
many days following, not a question was
ever asked. He was ushered always into
the same room, where he was greeted
most graciously.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his fourth visit,
after the Princess had conversed with
him on many subjects, she asked him
somewhat suddenly if he was betrothed
or married.</p>

<p>And when he answered that he was
not it seemed to him that she appeared
pleased. Then a long silence fell between
them, which he of course did not
attempt to break.</p>

<p>"My friend," she said at last, and
her manner was somewhat nervous and
embarrassed, "I am glad that your
affections are not placed elsewhere,
because I myself, strange as it is for a
woman to tell a man, desire to wed
with you. To my father's Court have<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
come many who have sought my hand
in marriage, but in none have I seen
those qualities which I admire and
esteem&mdash;&mdash;" she paused.</p>

<p>The low, thrilling words stole on the
listener's ear in sweet, subdued cadence.
Did he hear aright? He doubted it; he
feared that he only dreamt.</p>

<p>Then he looked at her where she sat,
with her shimmering jewels glancing a
thousand hues, and his heart throbbed
and his brain reeled, and he was as if
drunk with wine.</p>

<p>He knew not how to answer this
beautiful, gracious lady.</p>

<p>How she must love him, he thought,
when she could so stoop from her high
estate. He dropped on his knees before
her. "Ah," he murmured, "where
could I find fitting expressions in
which to tell you what I feel? Your
words have lifted me to complete<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
Nirvana, I shall never dwell on earth
again. Speech is but a poor thing often,
therefore I will not say much. Deeds
are best; it is by them, O Princess, that
you shall read my heart."</p>

<p>She smiled, and her eyes were softly
tender as they met his.</p>

<p>"There is but one thing," she said,
after a few moments; "my father must
not be told till after we are married; he
would not sanction our union, though
he will forgive us afterwards. Therefore
you must take me hence, away from out
the kingdom for some time; then, when
my father's just anger shall have faded,
as it surely will, we will return together."</p>

<p>The young man listened in rapt
attention, scarcely crediting even yet his
own great fortune.</p>

<p>"And yet I scarcely see," gravely
pursued the Princess, after a short
silence, "how it can be managed."<span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>She rose as she spoke and advanced
to where a box of ivory, inlaid with
opals, stood, touched a spring and
opened it.</p>

<p>"See," she cried, "this is all the
money I own," taking in her hands a
few small worthless pieces of silver; "I
have never required money till now,
all that I have ever wanted has been
always beside me."</p>

<p>"Do not fear if it is only money that
you need," answered the young man;
"for of that I have more than enough."</p>

<p>"Ah! is that so?" she exclaimed
eagerly, turning to him a face of glad
surprise.</p>

<p>"At home," he continued, "I have
much of jewels and gold which I got
but a little while back; sufficient to
keep us in that luxury which is due
to your rank, for many a year to come."</p>

<p>"Go and fetch it," urged the Princess,<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
"and return here at nightfall, and I will
go with thee to another life&mdash;a life of
happiness such as this world seldom
holds."</p>

<p>Her great eyes glittered as she spoke.</p>

<p>He read in her words, her looks, and
her gestures only the fond impatience of
a love long, secret, and denied.</p>

<p>He prostrated himself, and saying, "I
will return at nightfall," left her to
hurry on his errand.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the early evening, when the darkness
had only just fallen, he drove in a
carriage to the palace; he left it at a
little distance from the great gold
entrance, and taking on his person
much of his stolen treasure, he was
ushered into the Princess's room; the
swinging lamps were lit and shed a faint
radiance on all around.</p>

<p>She was by herself, and greeted him<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
in a manner that left nothing to be
desired.</p>

<p>Wishing to assure her of the existence
of that money and those jewels
that he had spoken of, and feeling
nervously elated, he drew from the
recesses of his turban and sash a handful
of great stones, that were as rivers of
light; she gave a woman's delighted
cry as she took them in her hands.</p>

<p>He smiled, well pleased, and tendered
a great ruby of wondrous size and
blood-red fire.</p>

<p>"These are but a few of what I have,"
he said.</p>

<p>"How rich you must be!" she exclaimed,
"From whence did all these
things come?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Princess, what matter whence
they came? Sufficient it is that now
they are yours."</p>

<p>As he spoke she, unseen by him,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
touched a gong of curious workmanship
that stood near.</p>

<p>Then she held the stones up to the
light, praising their beauty and worth,
and asking many questions.</p>

<p>A short while passed and then a great
door at the end of the room opened
and the King entered, followed by the
four fakirs, and advanced to where his
daughter sat.</p>

<p>The young man's heart beat in alarm
at the sight of those whom he had
robbed. And the Princess's first words
did not tend to decrease the feeling.</p>

<p>"Are these some of the treasures that
you have lost?" she asked, handing to
the elder of the four the biggest of the
diamonds and the rubies. He took
them in his hand, then passed them to
the others, saying, at the same time&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are ours."</p>

<p>"There stands the thief, then," said<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
the Princess, pointing to the now cowering
shaking figure of the culprit, who
looked piteously from one to the other,
feeling at the same time very enraged
with himself for having been so easily
caught in the trap that had been laid
for him. "It is for you," continued
the Princess, addressing herself to the
four, "when your entire treasure has
been restored to you, to name his
punishment."</p>

<p>The elder of them answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are so rejoiced to regain that
which we had feared was lost for ever,
Princess, that we are willing that he
should go forth unchastised; his conscience,
and what it will say to him, will
be his punishment."</p>

<p>"That would be too light a sentence;
for I doubt much if he has any conscience,"
said the lady, as she seated
herself.<span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>"Then, Princess, will you relieve us
by sentencing him yourself, as you best
will?" craved the four.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "that I cannot
do, I might be too harsh&mdash;I have
convicted him; let His Majesty, who is
ever lenient, name his punishment."</p>

<p>Then they all turned to the King,
who said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I command that he be banished
from this land for ever, and any property
that he has, or is likely to have, be
confiscated."</p>

<h2>THE VIGIL OF MAH MAY.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">MAH MAY was a little Burmese
girl who kept a small stall filled
with cheroots in one of the crowded
many-coloured streets of Rangoon.
There she sat all through the sultry,
languorous days smoking and waiting,
with philosophical calm, for customers;
now and then a great, big, well-fed looking
Indian would stop and handle her
goods, and, grumbling perhaps a little,
would eventually buy; or a lean Chinaman,
in baggy blue trousers, would
pause and smile and talk awhile; or some
little naked child would come and beg<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
one for nothing; or the black coolies,
their silver belts glittering in the sunlight,
would cluster round and bargain and
quarrel among themselves, perhaps, in
the end, throwing her goods back to her
with no very complimentary language;
or a "Chetty,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> airily attired in scanty
white muslin, his shaved head protected
by a big cotton umbrella, would come
and haggle over the annas as a poor
Burman would never dream of doing;
then, again, a well-to-do woman of her
own race, dressed in silk, and with gold
bracelets on her wrists, would purchase,
but they were always, as Mah May used
to say with a shake of her small head,
the meanest of all.</p>

<p>She was a bright little girl, though
very poor; often hungry, and always
wretchedly clad.</p>

<p>For two years past she had squatted<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
behind her tray, in the hot, hard, cruel
glare, when the sun beat on the flat-roofed
white houses mercilessly; when
even the river, with its forests of ships,
seemed to cease to flow; when all things
were gasping and weary and the gharry
wallahs slept soundly, and the poor lean
ponies tried to flick the flies off their
backs with their tails; when the Indian
shopkeepers stretched themselves on
wooden beds just in the shadow of their
door-ways and snored away, dreaming of
rupees and curry; while only the pariah
dogs scratched and smelt in the road
for something to eat. No one stirred;
the drowsy influence of the heat seemed
universal. Or on the dull wet days,
when the sky was clouded and rain
poured down, soaking everything through
and through, and the thin coloured
dresses clung pitifully round their
owners' dark forms, and nobody had<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
time to think of buying as they passed
on in the warm, damp, oppressive atmosphere.
Still Mah May sat, no
matter what the season, rolling her
cheroots, cutting betel chews, and
crooning some little song to herself.
At mid-day she ate some rice, and
got a draught of water from a pump
not far distant. Often some one was
kind, and gave her some fruit or a
cake; oftener they were unkind, but
oftener still they were indifferent.</p>

<p>It was a hard life&mdash;very, and she was
only seventeen. Yet was she content.
Nature had been her nurse. The sun
and the rain had made her what she was&mdash;a
hardy, honest, upright little soul,
envying and hating no one.</p>

<p>When the shadows grew long and
the green shutters of the shops closed,
Mah May rolled up her wares and
wended her way homewards through<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
the noisy, many-hued crowds to a miserable
wooden hut, which stood in dirty
yellow water, spanned by a rotten plank,
and was situated in one of the poorest
and most squalid quarters of the town&mdash;a
quarter in which poverty, in its most
hideous form, stalked. Half-clothed
men, women and children of all ages,
dwelt together there, and kept life in
them as best they could.</p>

<p>In the huts there was scarce one
piece of furniture, save perhaps a bed
or a roll of matting or a ragged purdah.</p>

<p>The scorpions, the white ants, and
the great toads held high revel. Amidst
rows, hard words, evil things, cries of
little children, and growls of half-starved
dogs Mah May dwelt, and was happy.</p>

<p>She did not know of any better life
than hers. The day passed in the fresh
air under the changeless azure of the
skies and the night curled up in a<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
corner of the hut, with the purple stars
looking down through some chink in
the roof; and knowing of any other,
it is doubtful if she would have cared
to exchange.</p>

<p>Mah Khine, a black-browed woman
whom Mah May had lived with as long
as she could remember, was very good
and kind to her in her own way; but
she had many children tugging at her
skirt, and her life was a very hard one.
She was married to an Indian who had
nearly all the faults of his by no means
faultless race; his past had been bad,
his present was even more so.</p>

<p>He counted the cost of anything,
done or undone, as small if it only
brought in pice; pice sufficient to
procure "toddy,"<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the hot, horrible,
poisonous stuff kept in the little shop
<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
by a Chinaman in one of the narrow,
tortuous bye-lanes of the native quarter.
To him it mattered nothing that his
children had oftentimes not enough to
eat, and that the lines about his wife's
patient mouth deepened.</p>

<p>The passion for drink possessed him,
to the exclusion of all other feelings.</p>

<p>Stretched on a wooden settle in the
crowded, dirty shop that abutted on
the still dirtier street, reeking with filth
and smells, he passed his time sunk
in a semi-conscious stupor.</p>

<p>The proprietor looked upon Moulla
Khan as one of the best customers he
had.</p>

<p>For him was his smile the sweetest,
to him was he most accommodating in
the matter of money.</p>

<p>Of a day the frequenters of the place
were comparatively few, but when the
night crept on, Pun Lun lit up his place<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
with many sickly oil lamps, whose light
showed up the gaudy signboard with
its ill-written "Toddy Shop" on it,
surrounded by a curious design in
Chinese, and drew the human moths
round in dozens to smoke, drink, play,
and talk. Indian, Burmese, all countries
were represented there in that crowded,
noisy, dirty place. The babel of many
tongues broke on the ear afar off.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood was a notoriously
bad one, so that the fighting and sickening
sound of blows that usually ended
these gatherings of convivial spirits
excited no comment.</p>

<p>Even the deep groans from those who,
wounded, lay helplessly for many hours
gained no sympathy or succour of any
kind.</p>

<p>Often, but in vain, in the hot, sulphurous
nights Mah Khine had found
her way there, and begged of the great<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
coarse brute whom she called husband
to return with her, but for a long time
past she had ceased to plead, realising
how useless it was.</p>

<p>And yet, strangely, with all his
drunkenness and cruelty, the faithful
soul refused to desert or even see him
as he really was. He had been the
chosen one of her girlhood, when she,
young and pretty, had left her people to
wed this stranger out of India.</p>

<p>They had deemed her disgraced by
the union.</p>

<p>They had been well-to-do people, and
would have married her to one of her
own race.</p>

<p>Her life had held many bitter, unhappy
years, but she was proud in her
way, and from her lips no word or moan
had ever passed.</p>

<p>Children had come and multiplied,
and though the wants of such people<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
are very few, often they had not the
wherewithal to supply them.</p>

<p>But of late years things had been
better, for Mah Khine, who had a keen
eye for business, had made and saved
a little unknown to every one except
Mah May.</p>

<p>The money was kept buried away in
a teak-wood box in a corner of their
damp, worm-eaten house.</p>

<p>Mah Khine's cherished ambition,
trader that she was, was to open a
little shop, as many of her class did.</p>

<p>A little place filled with miscellaneous
articles: pillows, lacquer boxes,
wooden trays, crockery, pewter pans,
some sandals, and perhaps, there was
no knowing&mdash;that is, if she was
lucky&mdash;some tameins and silk potsos
for the men.</p>

<p>There behind it the proud possessor,
she dreamt that she would sit and roll<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
the cheroots and have her children by
her, keeping an eye on the younger as
they played.</p>

<p>This picture Mah Khine often
painted to herself; it was her ideal of
earthly bliss. She dreamt of it by day
and night, but kept it locked up in
her own heart.</p>

<p>Anything that she could spare from
what she made by washing the clothes
of her richer neighbours she put by so
carefully, handling it so fondly, storing
it so cautiously: grimy brown pice,
little silver pieces, one or two soiled,
crumpled notes, how often she looked
at them and counted them and took
them in her lean brown hands! She
would start out of her sleep, fearing
some one had stolen her treasure, that
represented the scraping together of
two hard, long years.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>There was some little history attached
to every coin.</p>

<p>She remembered how each one was
gained, every circumstance of toil or
sacrifice through which it was put by.</p>

<p>And not a soul knew, not a soul
save Mah May and herself; Mah May
she could trust. Mah May loved her,
and was as honest and true as a little
dog.</p>

<p>Mah Khine never left the box in the
house with no one to mind it, for fear
it should be taken, though for two
years gone by it had rested securely
and undisturbed in its hiding-place.</p>

<p>The knowledge of its existence, and
what in the end it was to accomplish,
leant a courage to her to bear with
the blows, the sickness, and the abject
poverty of her surroundings; it upheld
her, it leant a brightness to her eyes,
a lightness to her feet when they would<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
have been otherwise pitifully weary.
When she spoke there was oftentimes
a strange ring of gladness in her voice;
for Hope, that wonderful strengthener,
dwelt with her.</p>

<p>So time went on, and it wanted but
three months for the money to be complete.
They had been rarely lucky.</p>

<p>Mah May had sold well every day.
Mah Khine had had much to do. A
great content abode with her. Even the
morose, savage manner of her husband
troubled her but little.</p>

<p>The children flew at his approach,
and hid behind the mud hill close by, or
their mother's ragged skirts, or anywhere
they could, and she soothed and
comforted the little trembling ones as
she best could, and on her face was a
happy smile.</p>

<p>"At last! at last!" she thought.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span>One warm, clear night, when the sky
glittered with stars, and a young moon
showed against it, Mah Khine made
ready to take some silks that she had
been washing home. She had promised
them, for it was the eve of a great
Buddhist feast. It was a long way for
her to go, right across the town, but she
did not mind. So she cleared up the
remains of their evening rice, swept the
floor with her straw besom, filled the
water-chatty standing in the corner
afresh, bade Mah May to watch carefully;
and Mah May assured her, as
she had often done before, that if any
one was ever to find out their secret,
the money they should never have, save
they killed her first. So Mah Khine
took up her bundle and went forth into
the radiance of the night.</p>

<p>Mah May looked after her until she
was out of sight, and then squatted
down, smoking.<span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>The hours went by; the lights were
put out in the huts. Mah May felt
very sleepy and tired where she sat, but
she was good&mdash;she remained awake,
staring out into space....</p>

<p>A tall, dark figure stood before her.
It was Moulla Khan; he had not been
home for two days. His eyes were
blood-shot, his turban disarranged. He
stood over her, and looked down at her.
She trembled a little; she feared him
greatly. She stirred uneasily, but nevertheless
met his look without flinching.</p>

<p>He only uttered one word, and that
in a voice which drink had rendered
hoarse and thick.</p>

<p>"Money." He spoke in Hindustani.</p>

<p>"I have none," she answered him in
the same tongue.</p>

<p>He gave a sort of gurgling laugh.</p>

<p>"Look you," he muttered, "I know
there is money hidden somewhere&mdash;pice<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
and annas and rupees&mdash;and I will have
it; I know it, I tell you, I know it."</p>

<p>"There is none," the girl replied.
She had risen; she had her back to the
hole in the wall where the money was.</p>

<p>"Give it to me," he cried, in a voice
of frantic rage.</p>

<p>"I do not know who has told you this
thing," she said, "but it is not true."</p>

<p>She felt chilly with fright. She
knew that, once his suspicion aroused,
he would search till he found. She
would be powerless to protect it. Tears
dimmed the fond eyes of the child.
She knew, none better, all the toil,
privations, and hopes that lay in that
poor little box.</p>

<p>Yet what could she do? She was so
small and her strength so puny. If he
searched he would find it; its hiding-place
was not so secure as to be proof
against those cruel fingers.<span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>Though all Mah Khine's future lay
there, she gave no sign of fear. She
kept her ground boldly. He shook her
savagely, when she stood. She was
wondering who could have told him.
She watched him with a dull, throbbing
brain move unsteadily round the
wretched room, groping by the light
of the moon; feeling, feeling everywhere
along the wall for holes; turning
over all the things; then, with a
muttered word or two, out he went on
to the rafters, made of mud, behind,
into a little piece of ground; but there
was nothing, nothing anywhere. Her
breath came a little quicker, a little
more freely. Perhaps, after all&mdash;but,
with a bound, he was by her side. He
nearly wrenched her slender, childish
wrists off. "It is there!" he cried in
triumph.</p>

<p>She set her strong white teeth in his<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
black arm; but with a brutal gesture
he flung her light weight from him.
She fell with a dull, heavy thud. He
did not heed her for awhile, searching
eagerly, thirstily, his eyes glittering with
cruel greed.</p>

<p>At last he drew it forth triumphantly,
the poor little shabby treasure-house,
and took the money, letting some drop
in his haste, hiding it with trembling,
feverish hands in his white linen jacket.</p>

<p>Then he put the box back, and
turned to Mah May. He looked; she
was very still; he crept nearer and
nearer, and his cowardly soul shrank
within him. The moonbeams had found
her out and fell upon her thin, upturned
face. He peered round, he held his very
breath; no one was stirring, there was
silence everywhere. His dark, acquiline
face was as cunning as that of any fox
cub. He paused for a second or two.<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
Then, as if a sudden thought struck
him, he gathered her up hastily in his
arms.</p>

<p>She was a little heavy, but he was
strong.</p>

<p>The river, that was drifting outward
to the ocean, and the moon were the
only things that shared the secret of
that night with him.</p>

<p>And they guard their secrets well.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"If Mah May wanted the money,
I would have given it to her, for I loved
her; she need not have left me," Mah
Khine said, with a great sorrow and
sense of desolate despair in her heart,
and tears in her honest eyes, when
Moulla Khan told his tale.</p>

<p>She never learnt different&mdash;she never
will&mdash;unless, indeed, the day dawns
when the sea shall give up its dead.</p>

<p class="h4">THE KING'S PALACE.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PETITION TO THE KING.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">IN the reign of King Mindoon, who
was the father of King Theebaw,
a servant sent a petition to him in which
he set forth that he had been his humble
and faithful servitor before his accession
to the throne, but now, although seven
long years had gone by since then, he
had remained forgotten and unnoticed.
Continuing in this strain for a space, he
ended with the following parable:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Zita country there lived a King
who had a son named Padoma, whom he
sent to Thakada to be educated, and
with him he sent a young attendant
called Thomana.<span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>For three years they stayed at Thakada,
at the end of which period the
Prince, having completed his studies,
prepared to return home; on their way,
travelling by easy stages, they paused
at a small village situated in deep-wooded
lands, where a great feast was being
held. Hundreds of people had gathered
there from all parts. A large tent was
erected in one part, where a banquet was
spread, to partake of which they humbly
begged the Prince.</p>

<p>And he willingly accepted.</p>

<p>On the ground had been spread matting,
on a part of which a gorgeously
embroidered scarlet cloth with a golden
fringe was put for the Prince, and a
white one, less magnificently worked and
with a silver fringe, for his friend and
attendant Thomana.</p>

<p>When they had seated themselves,
the rest of the company did likewise,<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
remaining, however, at a distance, and
separated by a cord.</p>

<p>Now Thomana was very learned in
astrology, having read and thought
deeply on that subject, and he knew as
soon as he saw the Prince seat himself
on the red cloth that he would become
King upon that very day.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant assembly, every one
clad in delicate silks of all hues, and
glittering with jewels. The feast lasted
long, it seemed, indeed, as if the constant
succession of dishes was to be an
endless one. All were in the best of
spirits, and laughed and talked greatly.</p>

<p>When the Prince had finished his repast,
he was shown into an inner tent,
where a couch of the same royal colour
had been placed, and in front was a
slightly raised platform of bamboo,
draped with violet and rose-pink satin,
richly worked and lighted with lamps,<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
that shed a subdued radiance round and
about the little graceful figures of several
dancing girls who had been bidden to
dance for his royal highness.</p>

<p>Their dresses were so formed as to
represent armour, and on their heads
were similar coverings. They performed
peculiar, dreamy, kind of movements,
amidst a mist of varying hues. The
Prince was much interested, and postponed
retiring until late.</p>

<p>Thomana, having bidden his royal
master good-night, felt disinclined for
sleep, so, strolling into a park-like demesne
that was adjacent, he seated himself
under a large tree, whose branches
spread for a considerable way, and became
lost in thought.</p>

<p>It was a glorious night, with not a
sound in the air save the soft whirr of
some purpled-eyed or golden-winged
insect as it floated by in the darkness.<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
As he sat there musing on the events
of the evening and the future of the
Prince, two large leaves fell from above
into his hand: one was old and withered,
the other was fresh and green. "Ah,"
he murmured, as he looked at them,
"in the same way as an old and a young
leaf drops from the tree, so may a man
full of years and one who is in the
morning of life die at the same time."</p>

<p>In the midst of his meditations, which
lasted long, he became a rahan,<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and was
taken from the garden to the Gandremadana
Mountains. At the same time a
chariot of pearl, drawn by four pure
white horses with trappings of gold, was
on its way to the Prince to carry him
back, as his father had died that day.
Following the chariot came four ministers
and a train of Court officials, accompanied
by soldiers.</p>

<p>[90]They awakened the sleeping Prince and
acquainted him with their news. Then,
when he was prepared, he stepped into
the chariot that was waiting, and was
borne with all speed to the palace, where
he was proclaimed King the following
day with the utmost pomp, ceremony,
and rejoicings.</p>

<p>In his new life, and amidst his many
duties and responsibilities, he entirely
forgot the existence of his attendant, who
had been his constant companion for
three years; therefore his absence passed
unrecorded and unnoticed; for what the
King forgets the courtiers must never be
unwise enough to remember.</p>

<p>At the end of thirty years, when the
King was getting old, he remembered
Thomana, and wondered greatly where
he might be. Whereupon he immediately
caused it to be made known
throughout his dominions that he would<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
give a lac of rupees to any one who
should give him any news of his lost
servant.</p>

<p>Now Thomana, owing to his great
piety and powers of clairvoyance, became
aware immediately of the fact that his
old master had recollected him, and
desired his presence. Therefore he went
at once to the garden where he had
been seated before he attained his rahanship
so many years before. Close by
the tree, under whose branches he had
sat, were four shepherd boys, their flocks
grazing near, while they themselves
talked together of the big reward that
the King had offered for news of his old
servant.</p>

<p>Thomana, coming through the leafy
aisles, heard them, and accosted them,
declaring that he was the person whom
the King desired. They rose and
glanced at him doubtingly.<span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>"Let two of you," he said, "go to the
palace and tell His Majesty, that I await
him here." To which they assented.</p>

<p>A short while passed, and then an
immense carriage, glittering like gold
and silver in the sun, and followed by
others less imposing, could be seen
coming rapidly along the white winding
road. Pulling up at the entrance, the
King himself alighted, and came through
the gates, that were all brazen and
blazoned, straight towards Thomana, his
arms outstretched to embrace him; but
he whom he would have greeted so
cordially stopped him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am now a rahan; with men,
their feelings, their passions, their brief
triumphs, and sorrows, likes and dislikes,
I have no affinity." Then he
folded his arms and stood in silence.</p>

<p>His face was very cold and still.</p>

<p>The King, looking at him, saw that<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
he was poorly clad, and bent, and thin,
and pressed him to return to the Court,
where he promised him money and many
wives.</p>

<p>But the rahan answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not need wealth, nor any of
the poor fleeting pleasures that this
world can offer. Let your Majesty
come with me instead, and visit my
abode of rest."</p>

<p>"What is it like, this place,"
inquired the King in wonder, "that it
can render its inhabitants indifferent to
what we esteem the most desirable of
all things in this life?"</p>

<p>"It is situated far from here," replied
Thomana, "and the approach to it is a
broad, long avenue of gorgeous blossoms,
such as you have never dreamed of, that
bloom for ever, with a perfume that is
at once dreamy, drowsy, and infinitely
sweet; vast sprays of water spring from<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
the mouths of silver dragons; over
head the branches of trees interlace,
showing but a strip of blue sky
through their quivering leaves. For
hours can you wander amongst these
mazes of roses, this wonder of colour
and beauty. At the end of the grove
is situated an immense tree, larger than
aught that you have seen and higher
than any eye could reach. It is surrounded
by columns of marble that glow
like jewels. Here the n&#x0101;ts and fairies
dwell, with nothing to disturb their
seclusion and solitude save the sound
of falling waters and the song of
birds. While over all is cast such a
spell as this life does not hold. Ah!
beside the perfection of that world, how
poor and valueless are the things of
this! There one talks with the gods
and dwells in worlds beyond the sun.
There is no room for regrets or for<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
desires. There every one is beautiful,
therefore we do not covet beauty. There
wealth is common to all, therefore we do
not desire it. There all are equal, and
love and goodness are the aim and end of
all things. Come and see for yourself,"
he added.</p>

<p>And the King, marvelling greatly at
what he had heard, went. And there,
in the midst of those divine surroundings,
with naught to disturb the mind
from the good, he wandered, awed and
silent, but not afraid. In those cool,
wide halls of bliss, all memories of
grosser things and ways faded into
nothingness. He forgot his kingdom,
and was by it forgot.</p>

<h2>THE PRIEST'S PETITION.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">IT was the custom for the heir to the
throne of the kingdom of Ava to be
placed, while young, in a monastery with
the priests, to be instructed in a manner
suitable to the position that he was
destined to occupy. Prince Min
Goung, while a boy, was put under
the special care of the Phoongyee Shin
Ah Tah Thaya&mdash;a prudent and learned
man, who gave all his time and wisdom
to his pupil.</p>

<p>Min Goung was of a proud and
wilful nature, and one who would not
willingly bend his haughty head to any
yoke, however light and silken.</p>

<p>One day his reverend teacher punished<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
him, for persistent bad writing, somewhat
severely&mdash;an act which he regretted
afterwards, thinking, perhaps, that he
had been over harsh.</p>

<p>Time passed away. The King died,
and the young Prince was crowned.
Then the priest began to fear that his
former pupil might do him some harm,
for he imagined that he had never forgiven
him the liberty he had taken in
chastising him. So he quitted his
retreat, and fled to Prome for safety.
Disliking his enforced banishment, he
determined to write and crave for
pardon; and in the course of his long
appeal, written on palm leaves, was the
following story:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was a king of Bayanathee,
learned and merciful, who had a hundred
sons, each of whom, when old enough,
was given into the hands of a carefully
selected instructor to be taught those<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
subjects for which he had the greatest
taste. When each was grown up and
had completed his education, he was
appointed a governor of a portion of
the royal dominions; and so ninety-nine
of the Princes had been educated and
been presented to the King and received
their appointments. Prince Thanwara
was the youngest of them, and was taken
care of by a distinguished minister, who
began and continued his instruction in a
way that was very suitable to the quick
natural intelligence of the boy; and
when the time came for Thanwara to go to
his father, his teacher accompanied him.</p>

<p>"When they came before the King&mdash;who
was seated on a throne of silver
and agate, with golden doors behind
him&mdash;he asked his son if he had learnt
and completed the same course of studies
as his elder brothers, and the young
Prince answered him<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I am sufficiently qualified, sire, to
take upon me the same duties and
responsibilities as those of my brothers
who have gone before.'</p>

<p>"The King was satisfied with the
reply; and then, after a while, the
Prince and his tutor returned to their
home.</p>

<p>"Talking to the tutor before he slept,
Thanwara said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'If the King my father offers me
the same position as he has bestowed
on my brothers, will it be well with me
to accept it?'</p>

<p>"The teacher made answer thus&mdash;</p>

<p>"'If a man, O Prince, desires to
partake of the Bandaya fruit, which only
grows in Nirvana, can he obtain it from
its tree from the distance of a hundred
yujanas (eight hundred miles), or would
he rather not stand under the tree and
take the fruit with a hooked bamboo?<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
In the same way, if you wish to sit on
the throne it is best for you not to go
from here, but to remain in the shadow
of the palace.'</p>

<p>"The prince listened, and then, when
he had heard to the end, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Then, my teacher, when to-morrow
I go before my father, and he asks me
my desires, what shall I make reply?'</p>

<p>"'Ask of him to bestow on you the
rents of the bazaars and the produce or
the royal gardens within the city gates.'</p>

<p>"'Of what benefit would such be to
me?'</p>

<p>"'The greatest benefit, my son. For
those who have money have power, of
which truth I will give you an illustration:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'A timid doe in the forest, when it
once sees a leopard, will fly, and hiding
carefully, will not venture to stir out
again for many days and nights; but<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
on the other hand, retiring as it is by
nature, it will, if a person constantly feed
it, so far lose its timidity as to approach
him and take from his hand. Therefore,
my son, if you give presents often to
the favourites and the advisers of the
King, you will gain their confidence and
their liking.'</p>

<p>"On the following day, when the
Prince reached the palace, and his father
asked him to name the province that
he wished to govern, he answered
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My brothers have all gone from
you to distant parts of the world to
guard over your vast possessions; let
me then remain here to be your
Majesty's attendant, and render you
that care and assistance in sickness, in
health, and in trouble, or any other trial,
that affection can alone offer.'</p>

<p>"The old King was pleased, and<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
granted unhesitatingly what he was
asked.</p>

<p>"From that day forth Thanwara
received the rents and profits of the
bazaars and gardens, and took up his
residence near the throne, in the white
palace of his father.</p>

<p>"Gradually his winning manners, his
deference to his elders, his many
thoughtful and beautiful gifts, and,
lastly, his own piety and learning,
gained for him the first place in the
hearts of those who were about the
Court.</p>

<p>"So the years fled away, and were
counted with the past.</p>

<p>"But when the tenth year was young,
the King's health failed him; he felt
that the sands of his life were nearly
run. So about him he gathered his
ministers and advisers. After they
had expressed their sympathy and regret<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
at finding him ill, they inquired which
of all his sons he would best like to
wear his crown when he was gone.</p>

<p>"The dying King raised himself from
the low couch on which he was reclining,
and, propped by many cushions,
answered their question in this wise:</p>

<p>"'A hermit was one day coming
from his lonely Himalayan abode
through a forest. Over his head, as
a sunshade, he had an enormous flower,
called the kakayu mala, which is found,
as you are aware, only in the N&#x0101;t
Country, and its fragrance reached to
the distance of one yujana (eight miles).
On his way he encountered four fairies,
each of whom saw and coveted the
blossom. They all in turn asked him
for it, but he said, in reply to their
request, "I can only give it to the
most virtuous and the most excellent
of you all."<span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>"'Whereupon each protested, all
contending for the honour.</p>

<p>"'But the hermit, who was discreet
and prudent, said, "How can I, who
have no means to judge, decide? To
me you all seem worthy of it, equally
charming, and deserving in all respects,
therefore had I four flowers I would
divide them gladly between you; but
as there is but one, and that one incapable
of division, we will refer the
matter to the King of the N&#x0101;t Country,
who has the all-discerning eye."</p>

<p>"'So they went.</p>

<p>"'They had not to travel far before
they came to his green and gracious
kingdom.</p>

<p>"'They made straight for the beautiful
ivory palace where the King dwelt,
and were ushered into where he sat on
his throne, composed entirely of the
very flowers.<span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>"'He inquired what brought them
before him.</p>

<p>"'They told him. Then he thought
for a little time, while they waited at a
distance. When he called them to him
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'"There is a rahan residing in the
Kisokok Mountains to whom I will
present a golden pineapple; then the
four of you shall go and seek him and
ask him for it. The person whom he
shall give the golden apple to, that
person shall be the most worthy in every
way to be the recipient of the flower."</p>

<p>"'They thanked him, withdrew, and
started for the Kisokok Mountains.</p>

<p>"'When they arrived there the rahan
requested each fairy to take up her
position according to the four directions
of the earth&mdash;north, south, east and
west&mdash;which they did, while each
clamoured for the prize.<span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>"'Then the rahan asked them their
names, to which the eldest replied,
"Thada" ("Charity"); the second,
"Thati" ("Peace"); the third,
"Hiri" ("Modesty"); the fourth,
"Ootoppa" ("Virtue").</p>

<p>"'When the rahan heard he gave
the golden apple into the hands of
Ootoppa, saying, as her name represented,
she was the most deserving.
Then she went to the hermit, who presented
her with the beautiful flower,
and from that moment she was esteemed
the most virtuous and most excellent of
all women in the N&#x0101;t Country.</p>

<p>"'Therefore,' continued the old
King, addressing the ministers around
him, 'you must be the hermit in this case.'</p>

<p>"Before that day was over he was
dead, and was interred with great
honours and many lamentations.</p>

<p>"Then the advisers, with no delay<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
and no hesitation, elected Prince Thanwara
to succeed his father; but when
the news reached the other sons in their
distant territories they were filled with
wrath. The second sent to his elder
brother a letter, in which he said that
the ministers of their late father were
weak and corrupt, and very wanting in
foresight in allowing themselves to be
persuaded into placing the youngest
of all on the throne, thereby disregarding
the principle of the ancient
rule of succession; for (continued he)
in the Ahrottaya Country there was
a King who had three children, two
sons and a daughter, born of the chief
Queen. When the eldest son was sixteen
years of age the Queen died. The
second Queen thereupon became chief,
by whom the King had a son, and when
that son reached eight years of age the
King was bitten by a snake, a fact<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
which frightened him greatly. The
Queen, however, who was quick to
think and very brave, sucked the poison
from the bite. The King, being filled
with gratitude, asked her to make any
request that she liked, which he would
grant, whereupon she immediately
begged that her son might be selected
as the heir to the throne, and to her
inexpressible satisfaction the King gave
his consent.</p>

<p>"A while later his Majesty sent for
Narada, a soothsayer, who was asked
to calculate his term of life. Narada
told him that he would live twelve
more years. The King then sent for
his three children by the dead queen
and acquainted them with the soothsayer's
prophecy, telling them at the
same time that they must quit the
Court and find a home elsewhere for
twelve years.<span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>"Sorrowing greatly, they obeyed.
After nine years the King died of
grief for the absence of the children
that he had sent from him.</p>

<p>"The Queen lost no time in scheming
to put the crown upon her son's
head. But the chief minister opposed
her, saying that the eldest boy still
lived and could not be put aside.</p>

<p>"Then he took the crown and all the
insignia of royalty, and with many attendants
and great state travelled to
where the eldest son resided, and offered
the throne to him.</p>

<p>"The Prince met him with the argument
that the King's commands extended
to twelve years, and that, as only nine
had elapsed, his step-brother must reign
for three years. Then he gave the
minister a pair of slippers, worked
with wheat, to give to his half-brother,
with the direction that they were to be<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
placed on the judgment-seat, declaring,
as he did so, that if any decision is
illegal or contrary to the right, the
slippers would of themselves rise and
touch each other as a protest.</p>

<p>"'Wherefore,' continued the brother's
epistle, 'as the ministers have not paid
you the respect of deferring to you in
the matter, we should prepare to go to
war with Thanwara.' The elder brother,
on receiving the above, addressed a letter
to his youngest brother, in which he
requested him to surrender the crown
or to prepare for hostilities.</p>

<p>"Prince Thanwara sought the advice
of his chief minister in his perplexity,
and he told him that, according to religion,
he must not oppose his elder
brother.</p>

<p>"'Then,' asked Thanwara, 'what am
I to do?'</p>

<p>"The chief minister answered: 'Divide<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
all the property in the kingdom into
one hundred shares, and give each
equally.'</p>

<p>"And it was accordingly done, upon
which the eldest brother, being quite
content, left the youngest in the possession
of the throne, saying that a hundred
kings could not reign in one country,
and that, if they tried, it would be for
the woe of the people.</p>

<p>"So all the brothers went back to
their own in peace and amity."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When the King of Ava read the
priest's letter, he was so well pleased
with the narrative that he sent a messenger
to him, and appointed him head
of the ecclesiastical body, with a residence
near the palace.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE COMMAND OF THE KING.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">THERE was a King of Amarapoora,
who reigned in a time
long past.</p>

<p>He was young and beloved, and fair
of form and face, and his people lived
but to obey his lightest wish. He dwelt
in a palace of crystal, surrounded by
gardens, of whose beauty no tongue
could tell. He had money and lands
and gems, and beautiful wives and unnumbered
treasures, gathered from all
lands.</p>

<p>He could have whatsoever he willed,
and go wheresoever he listed. His
days and nights were one long dream
of gladness.<span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>No enemies plagued him; no troubles
of any sort visited him; his coffers were
well filled, and his ministers were faithful
and wise; and yet, in spite of all,
he was weary of everything, more weary
than he could say.</p>

<p>He drank from a goblet of gold,
rimmed with a band of pearls, and his
clothes were studded with rubies and
emeralds; he was flattered and courted
and envied as no monarch had ever
been envied before, and he was more
discontented than the poorest subject
in his realms.</p>

<p>Above and around and about him was
all that is most conducive to happiness,
but within him were fatigue and desolation.</p>

<p>All that he had ever wished for had
been given unto him; never had the
gods left unanswered his prayers; other
and better men's they turned a deaf ear<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
to, but not so this King's, and now he
had nothing more left to crave for.</p>

<p>He had supreme power vested in his
hands, but he was indifferent to it; he
owned everything that the heart could
desire, and those very possessions were
killing him.</p>

<p>For the trail of the serpent of satiety
lay over his garden of Eden.</p>

<p>Never had his eyes rested on disease
or want or poverty, or anything that
could distress his mind.</p>

<p>All gifts and graces had been showered
upon him; his sins were buried in oblivion,
or cited more admiringly than the virtues
of others.</p>

<p>When he went abroad on his white
elephant, with its trappings of scarlet
and silver, the very air was perfumed
with otto of rose, while the people
bowed and kissed the dust through
which he passed.<span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>Attached to the palace were many
hundreds of officials, players, dancers,
jugglers, and clowns; for the King sought
only one thing, and that was&mdash;Amusement;
of which, in no matter what form
it was presented to him, he soon tired.</p>

<p>Constantly was the country being
searched for some one with a ready wit,
an inventive tongue, or a nimble foot, to
pass the hours for the Lord of the City
of Gems.</p>

<p>Tellers of marvellous stories, more
wonderful than the Arabian Nights, had
come, and tried their little best to
please.</p>

<p>There were those who travelled
specially to other countries, but to return
and tell him of all that they had
seen, and of how inferior all lands and
rulers were when compared with their
own.</p>

<p>Dancing women, with the classic<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
limbs and straight black brows of
Egypt, sought his favour.</p>

<p>Eyes that were as loadstars in their
brilliancy wooed him with a thousand
glances.</p>

<p>Circassian women, with sun-flecked
tresses, were his willing slaves.</p>

<p>Men of great learning asked nothing
better than to gain his ear awhile, but
all fatigued him soon.</p>

<p>And, like a child, he cried for something
new.</p>

<p>Then one day a stranger from India
presented himself at the great gates of
the palace, saying that he brought a
game called Chess to teach the King.
They who loitered round the entrance
bade him scornfully to "begone."
What would he of the Golden Feet
do with red and white figures like that?
they contemptuously asked.</p>

<p>But the Indian protested, craving<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
humbly to be granted an audience.
Then one, who was more kindly than
the rest, led him through the green,
silent gardens, with their aisles of
gorgeous roses; by spray-splashing fountains,
fringed with the lotus-flower; up
a flight of marble steps on to a terrace
where peacocks strolled; through carved
doors, from which stretched an endless
vista of halls and rooms filled with
numerous attendants, who formed a
mass of marvellous colour; carpets and
rugs of velvet-like softness were strewn
about; ivory of wonderful workmanship;
things of all precious metals, together
with stuffs of delicate hues and
lovely texture; to a chamber handsomer
than any that had gone before, where
at one end, seated on a couch, clad in
an odd, rich fashion, and shaded by a
large umbrella, was the King, his bare
feet resting on a stool; to his right was<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
a golden spittoon, while to his left stood
a slave holding a jewelled betel box
and some green cigars.</p>

<p>The Burmese prostrated himself almost
full length, motioning the Indian
to do likewise, explaining at the same
time the object of their presence.</p>

<p>His royal master received them
graciously, inquired into the merits
of the game, finally declaring that
he would be taught it there and
then.</p>

<p>From that time forth he devoted
himself to play with an eagerness
entirely foreign to his nature. He
paused for nothing, never going without
the palace. The days seemed not
half long enough. The courtiers were
inclined to congratulate themselves on
having at last found something that
seemed likely to continue a favourite
with the King, until they saw how high<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
the Indian was rising in his favour,
being loaded with money and presents,
and thereby becoming a cause of bitter
envy and jealousy on the part of the
Burmese ministers.</p>

<p>Nor did his haughty, overbearing
manner tend to soften their resentment.
Many were the plans that they made to
cause his downfall, but in vain. Every
one of the plots failed, while he whom
they conspired against seemed to grow
but dearer to the Lord of the Rising
Sun.</p>

<p>Time passed.</p>

<p>Then one came called Nicomar
from a great distance, who brought
painted cards and dice wherewith to
amuse the monarch, the like of which
had never been seen before. And the
King, like a spoilt baby, was delighted
with this new toy, and thrust away the
chess from his sight with disdain.<span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>And those round about were so glad
of the change that they hardly grudged
the new-comer the honours that their
royal master began to speedily heap
upon him.</p>

<p>The days went by, and His Majesty
did nothing but recline on his crimson
and golden cushions, playing and rattling
the dice-box.</p>

<p>Then, after awhile, he took to enlivening
the game by hazarding large bets
with his teacher&mdash;bets which generally
meant the performance of impossible
feats by Nicomar, with many penalties
attached to their non-accomplishment.</p>

<p>Often and sorely was Nicomar's
subtle mind perplexed to devise means
of circumventing his master's wagers,
and of distracting his attention to other
and more entertaining matters. Nicomar
lived always in fear of losing his
place at the palace. Inwardly, he hated<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
this unreasoning and unreasonable
monarch, whom nothing pleased for
long; outwardly, he was the most docile,
obedient, and fawning of servants.</p>

<p>Carefully did he veil his night-like
eyes, lest the hatred that shone in them
sometimes might be read by those
around.</p>

<p>Prostrate before the King, he seemingly
lived but for his smile.</p>

<p>The burning days and the sultry
nights he devoted to his service; while
others slept he sat wakeful, thinking
out new forms of amusement, new ways
to distract the King, and enable him to
retain that place which to him, hitherto
most poor and friendless, was as the
sorcerer's golden apple.</p>

<p>For Nicomar there was but one god&mdash;and
that god was wealth.</p>

<p>He laboured and strove for and
endlessly desired it.<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>A year went by, and still he remained
the favourite, and he began to feel a
little more secure and at ease....</p>

<p>"Nicomar," cried the King one day,
as they sat together in the sunset glow,
"I have resolved that you shall put milk
where the sea now is. I have tired of
water, and I desire instead an ocean of
milk."</p>

<p>Nicomar stared in dismay.</p>

<p>"That which your Majesty wishes is
impossible," he made answer.</p>

<p>The King frowned.</p>

<p>"Impossible is no word between you
and me. That which I command
must never be impossible," he exclaimed
angrily. "Hitherto you have obeyed my
orders; do so now."</p>

<p>The Indian trembled, but dared not
protest.</p>

<p>"Fill up the sea with milk in fourteen
days from now and your reward<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
shall be all that even you can desire;&mdash;fail
to do so and you shall die by all the
tortures possible within an hour. Do
as I say and your place shall be the very
highest here: your power shall be well-nigh
limitless, your name shall be on all
lips; men shall crouch at your feet;
you shall have a finer palace and greater
wealth than any in the land. Save
myself, you shall be great and free,
while those whom you love shall be
raised also."</p>

<p>Nicomar salaamed silently.</p>

<p>The King continued:</p>

<p>"You have known what it is to be
lowly and despised; you have been
mocked and reviled at,&mdash;what greater
or sweeter vengeance then to see those
very people bow down before you your
slaves? I desire this thing so much that
any price you like to name I am prepared
to give."<span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<p>The Indian answered never a word.</p>

<p>He knew of old that once the King
commanded it was useless to do aught
but comply.</p>

<p>This reward, great as it was, could
never be his, for to earn it was beyond
anybody's power.</p>

<p>"Begone, now," continued His Majesty,
"and return in fourteen days'
time to claim your prize, or&mdash;&mdash;" and
his gesture was more eloquent than
words.</p>

<p>Nicomar, with sorrowful, halting gait,
went from his august presence.</p>

<p>He sought without delay the quietude
of his own rooms. He was well-nigh
distracted. From many difficult predicaments
he had with consummate tact
and skill extricated himself, but from
this there seemed no escape.</p>

<p>He beat his breast and tore his hair.
He consulted the wise men and the<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
stars; looked for this sign and for
that; prayed long and fervently, and
propitiated the gods in many ways, but
all to no purpose.</p>

<p>He took no food or rest; he dared
not think of what awaited him in the
near future.</p>

<p>So a week went by, and he was no
nearer finding a loophole through which
to escape.</p>

<p>On the seventh day he sought the
King, and craved humbly to know if
he had understood him aright, or had
he been but jesting with him.</p>

<p>He lingered but a short while in
doubt.</p>

<p>His Majesty was deeply incensed at
being questioned, and let the full torrent
of his displeasure fall upon the head of
his luckless servitor.</p>

<p>Swearing many oaths by the sacred
hairs of Buddha that his will should be<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
obeyed, he had him thrust ignominiously
from his presence.</p>

<p>Then Nicomar went from out the
palace and the city far into the lonely
country, seeking he knew not what.
For days he wandered wearily through
thick jungle and silent forest ways,
stepping but slowly in the long, dank
grass.</p>

<p>He suffered greatly, and suffered
without hope.</p>

<p>On the fifth day he came to where a
broad river flowed and sparkled between
high green banks.</p>

<p>Some Burmese, driving bullocks, were
resting beside it, while in the distance
were a few mud huts.</p>

<p>Nicomar, who was footsore and faint,
sank down at the foot of a banana tree.</p>

<p>His garments were torn by branches
and brambles, his sight was blinded by
the sun, his mouth parched with thirst.<span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>Idly he watched the Burmese from
where he sat.</p>

<p>Soon it became apparent that they
desired to cross that glittering expanse
of water, but evidently knew not how
to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Nicomar, tired of thinking of his
own miseries, grew unconsciously interested.</p>

<p>Three of them twisted their silk
pasohs up about their waists, and tried
to wade the river; but it was too deep,
and they returned, seemingly much
perplexed.</p>

<p>Then they consulted together; whereupon
one among them&mdash;evidently against
the desire of his companions, as their
gestures betokened&mdash;took the rope of
his bullock between his teeth, and diving
into the river, with a good imitation of
swimming reached the other side.</p>

<p>His fellows watched the performance<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
with open-eyed wonder, but could not
be induced to follow his example.</p>

<p>Nicomar, looking on, thought that the
young man must have a mind full of
resource, and so determined to seek him
and consult with him. He could not
have told what was exactly the impulse
that urged him to this course, but he rose,
and staggering a little because he was
faint, made his way to the river bank.</p>

<p>The young fellow leant a very interested
and attentive ear to the strange
story that Nicomar told to him. When
he had finished he took him to his hut
and gave him a meal of rice, then bade
him go over the tale once more in all
its details.</p>

<p>Whereupon he asked at the conclusion&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I, poor and ignorant, satisfy the
King that his command can be performed,
what will you give unto me?"<span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>Nicomar, trembling with joy and
incredulity, promised him one half of
what he had and the hand of his
daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>Then the Burman said&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow we will seek the King."
More he would not say, but sat in the
dusky gloom of the coming evening,
smoking.</p>

<p>Nicomar, with the great weight of
his troubles somewhat lightened, slept
heavily.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On the morning of the fourteenth
day Nicomar prostrated himself before
his master.</p>

<p>"Well," asked the King, "come you
to claim your reward?"</p>

<p>The Indian bowed his head in grave
deferential assent.</p>

<p>"And so you have obeyed my
order?"<span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>"I but wait for your Majesty to
perform your part first, then I will without
delay do my share."</p>

<p>The King hastened to ask the
meaning of such an answer.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty commanded me,"
replied the Indian, "to fill up the sea
with milk, which I am quite ready to
do; but your Majesty did not command
me to take the water from the ocean,
and until that is done it is impossible to
fill it anew. If your Majesty," continued
Nicomar, "will but dispose of
the water&mdash;&mdash;." Then he paused
timidly, waiting the King's response.
He had done as the Burman had instructed
him, and he feared the result.</p>

<p>For a long while there was silence,
and those round about trembled with
apprehension, for they guessed not in
what wise their master would take such
a reply.<span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>At last he smiled, for although he
had many grave faults, he was not unkindly
or averse to owning himself
baffled.</p>

<p>Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nicomar, thou art cleverer than I
thought."</p>

<p>At which words hearts that had stood
still from fear beat once more.</p>

<p>"The sea exists," said his Majesty,
after a pause, looking round on his
Court, "as it existed before we were,
as it will exist when we have all passed
away and our names have been forgotten."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
